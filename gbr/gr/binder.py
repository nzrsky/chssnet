    """ Supplementary class to manage widget bindings.

        Tkinter management of event binding doesn't properly manage registration/deregistraion
        of multiple event consumers This class allows to handle such situations properly by
        keeping all callbacks registered to particular event and re-binding them if one gets
        revoked.
        In addition, it allows to register and bind to a custom events the same way as Tkinter
        does. For example, a dialog could raise <Close> event when it's been closed allowing
        consumers to get user input provided in the dialog.
